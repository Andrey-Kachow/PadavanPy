# Padavan
### (PadavanPy in the past)
My collection of various codes and scripts, which I am using to teach my friends, tutees or clients Python!

This repo contains Python code demos and exercises for beginners.
I also use the repo to explain git to newbies.

```
while True:
  print("I love Python!")
```

In addition to Python, I have created sections in C programming language.
As a tutor and volunteer, I popularise coding and need sources for my sessions.
That repository is not a single big project, but rather a collection of many small projects.
However, some of the projects use advanced topics and build fully functioning CLI utilities or even Websites.

As a person who pursues to deliver a great experience for my tutees and clients, I constantly keep myself accountable, learn and revise.

```
/**
 * Greeting
 */
public static void main(final String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to my repository!");
}
```

Recently I expanded the C Programming Language Section for better reference

## My students' projects honorable mentions:

1) Conway's Game of life
2) Pygame zero games...
